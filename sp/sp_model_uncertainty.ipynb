    "3. Attempt to normalize the 5% ~ 95% quantile range by dividing it by the mean of the posterior distribution of the estimated cell abundance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale is that, for a posterior distribution, the range between the 5% and the 95% quantile can be bigger if the mean is bigger. Therefore, we need a way to normalized the 5% ~ 95% quantile range, so that we can compare this range across different distributions (i.e. different locations and different cell types). One attempt I made was to divide this range by the mean of the posterior distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The caveat of this strategy is that, when the mean is very small, the normalized range becomes very large, so the normalized value in this case would be much higher than the case where the mean is bigger. However, we only care about the spots where the mean is considerable, because those are the spots with a certain amount of estimated cell abundance for which we want to quantify uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a better normalization approach still needs to be developed, one that perhaps excludes spots with very low mean, i.e. very low estimated cell abundance. "
